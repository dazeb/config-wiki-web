# Welcome to config.wiki
Config.wiki is a place for configurations of all types of apps and devices. If you have a configuration guide you can post it [here](/home)

> This documentation site is running on Wiki.js!

# Where to Start?
On the left you will find articles and categories for lots of devices and systems click the link to be taken to the page. Alternatively, you can use the search bat at the top of the website.

# Why?
I thought that there should be a hub for all types of configuration and the website is built using [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki) which allows for huge databases of information.
