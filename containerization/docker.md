# Docker & Docker Compose
Docker is a popular open-source containerization platform that allows users to easily package, deploy, and manage applications in a lightweight and portable manner. It allows users to create lightweight, standalone, and portable containers that contain all the necessary code, libraries, and dependencies needed to run an application.

Docker makes it easy for developers to build, test, and deploy applications quickly and consistently across different environments, such as development, staging, and production. It allows developers to focus on writing code and helps them avoid the hassle of setting up and maintaining complex environments for their applications.

Docker Compose is a tool that helps users define and run multi-container Docker applications. It allows users to define the relationships between containers in a single YAML file, and then use a single command to spin up all the containers in the application. This makes it easy for users to manage complex applications and deploy them consistently across different environments.

Overall, Docker and Docker Compose are powerful tools that help developers build, test, and deploy applications quickly and consistently, and are essential for anyone working with containerized applications.
