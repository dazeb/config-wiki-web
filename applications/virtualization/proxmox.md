# Proxmox
Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) is an open-source virtualization platform that allows users to easily create and manage virtual machines, containers, and storage on a single physical server. With PVE, users can run multiple operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, and BSD, on a single machine and use them as if they were running on their own dedicated hardware.

PVE is designed to be easy to use and requires minimal setup, making it ideal for small businesses, hosting providers, and IT professionals looking to virtualize their infrastructure. It features a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to quickly and easily create, manage, and monitor their virtual machines and containers.

In addition to its virtualization capabilities, PVE also includes a range of powerful tools for managing storage and networking. It supports a variety of storage options, including local storage, iSCSI, NFS, and Ceph, and allows users to easily create and manage storage pools and volumes. PVE also includes advanced networking features, such as VLANs, bonds, and firewalls, that allow users to easily create and manage virtual networks.

Overall, PVE is a reliable, scalable, and easy-to-use virtualization platform that is perfect for businesses and organizations looking to virtualize their infrastructure.
